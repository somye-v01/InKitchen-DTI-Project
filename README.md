# InKitchen-DTI-Project
This is our project submission for our DTI Project, you can read more about our idea and our offering in the README file below. Cheers!


For restaurant owners, managing multiple online food delivery orders can be a hassle. With multiple different platforms, it's hard to keep track of all the requests and orders.
Our solution is an easy-to-use dashboard that streamlines the process by allowing you to manage all of your online food delivery orders such as Zomato, Swiggy, Eat Sure all in one place. 
We also plan to integrate AI with it which could further help the restuarants get insightful data and help them grow their business to greater heights!
